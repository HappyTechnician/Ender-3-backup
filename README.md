# Ender-3-backup
A backup of the configuration files for my Ender-3 printer.
The printer is enclosed in an 1/4" acrylic chamber 24" x 24" x 36" =0.914 m 12'^
A 1000 Watt PTC heater with a Noctua 140mm hv fan heats chamber.
the printer uses LDO high temp stepper motors on all axis.
A BTT Manta E3EZ controller with a CM4-EMMC operate the printer,
along with a Rpi Pico-2350 that monitors the chamber temprature sensors.
